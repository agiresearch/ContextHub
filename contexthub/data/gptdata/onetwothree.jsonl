If the acacia trees in the savannah still have lush green leaves, then they are not showing signs of drought stress. When either the grasses are dry or the trees are drought-stressed, it means the vegetation in the savannah is struggling due to lack of water. This in turn leads to many herbivores having difficulty finding food.  \n\nA wildfire spreading through part of the savannah or humans clearing land for agriculture both result in the savannah habitat becoming fragmented. Unusually high summer temperatures or climate change altering precipitation patterns can lead to more frequent drought conditions in the savannah.

Instead, Stoicism aimed to achieve inner peace by mastering one's inner attitudes and reactions to events.\n\nThe Stoics are often associated with fatalism, the belief that all events are predetermined by divine providence or logos. However, this doctrine of causal determinism would seem to deny individuals have free will to make rational, ethical choices. So there is some tension in Stoic philosophy between its doctrines of virtue ethics and fatalism.\n\nStoicism was not the only major school in the period of Hellenistic philosophy. Epicureanism also developed as an influential tradition. So there was significant debate and diversity among competing Hellenistic philosophies, despite their shared cultural milieu. They had some foundational disagreements. \n\nAdditionally, while Zeno formally founded Stoicism, some of its key ethical doctrines had precursors in earlier Greek philosophy. So Stoic ethics creatively systematized and integrated earlier philosophical concepts in a new way.\n\nConsidering all this, did Stoicism make distinctively original contributions to Hellenistic moral philosophy? \n\n\nAnswer the question use: <answer>True</answer> or <answer>False</answer> or <answer>N/A</answer>, N/A means the result can not be deduced.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The Stoic school emphasized living in accordance with reason and virtue\" is True.\n\"Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BC\" is True.\n\"Stoic ethics stressed the importance of self-control and mental fortitude\" is True.\n\"The Stoics believed external events alone determine a person's wellbeing\" is False.\n(\"The Stoics believed external events alone determine a person's wellbeing\" and \"Stoic ethics stressed the importance of self-control and mental fortitude\") whose corresponding truth value is (False and True) logically implies \"Stoic ethics aimed to achieve inner peace through mastering one's attitudes and reactions\".\nThe premise (False and True) is False, thus, the value of \"Stoic ethics aimed to achieve inner peace through mastering one's attitudes and reactions\" cannot be deduced, and is set to N/A.\n\"Stoicism held that all events are fated by a divine logos\" is False.\n(\"The Stoic school emphasized living in accordance with reason and virtue\" and \"Stoicism held that all events are fated by a divine logos\") whose corresponding truth value is (True and False) logically implies \"Stoic fatalism implied individuals have no free will to make rational ethical choices\".\nThe premise (True and False) is False, thus, the value of \"Stoic fatalism implied individuals have no free will to make rational ethical choices\" is False.\n\"Stoicism was the only significant school of Hellenistic moral philosophy\" is False.\n\"Epicureanism also developed as a major Hellenistic philosophical tradition\" is True.\n(\"Stoicism was the only significant school of Hellenistic moral philosophy\" or \"Epicureanism also developed as a major Hellenistic philosophical tradition\") whose corresponding truth value is (False or True) logically implies \"There was philosophical diversity and debate among Hellenistic schools\".\nThe premise (False or True) is True, thus, the value of \"There was philosophical diversity and debate among Hellenistic schools\" is True.\n(\"Stoic fatalism implied individuals have no free will to make rational ethical choices\" and \"There was philosophical diversity and debate among Hellenistic schools\") whose corresponding truth value is (False and True) logically implies \"Hellenistic philosophies had some fundamental disagreements despite shared cultural influences\".\nThe premise (False and True) is False, thus, the value of \"Hellenistic philosophies had some fundamental disagreements despite shared cultural influences\" is False.\n(not \"Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BC\") whose corresponding truth value is (not True) logically implies \"Some Stoic doctrines originated earlier than Zeno's formal founding of the school\".\nThe value of the premise (not True) is False.
