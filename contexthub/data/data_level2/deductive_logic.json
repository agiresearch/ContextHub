And swans are not necessarily typical birds in all aspects. So even if all swans were white or swans were typical birds, it doesn't strongly imply swans are typical in terms of color.\nPutting it together, since swans seem to exist in different colors, or swans may be atypical in color specifically, we can reasonably hypothesize that new swan observations may diverge from the \"all white\" pattern seen initially. But more evidence would help support this hypothesis.\nCan we confidently conclude that future swan sightings will likely include non-white colors?\n"
